                                 : Our Achievement :

July 1, 2001, we started our journey with the name and style of “BENGAL REMEDIES”, a Marketing
        and Trading House of pharmaceutical products, on 1st July 2001 the particular day that is regarded
        as Doctors’ day, the birthday and the day of peaceful demise of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy.
        (Born in 1882, 1st July in Patna and demise on 1st July 1962).
        The journey of thousand and thousand miles begins with one step which never stops.
        It is a great pleasure on our part that we celebrate our each and every foundation day in
        several parts of india and also in Kolkata (specially in ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS, 2, Cathedral Road, Kolkata – 700071)
        We are just not a business organization – we are a family, a Pariwar, we don’t work just for the sake of a Company.
        We work for ourselves for the growth of our Pariwar. “Emotion gives the motion of a life” and emotional involvement
        enhances the degree of productivity, and it is needless to say that a man can never achieve to the tune of 100%
        without the combination of emotion crowned with Professionalism. We are neither the employees nor the employer or
        distributor; we are all the member of an “Emotionally integrated family”</p>
    We aim at serving the nation, particularly the rural part of the country and not just the urban crowd,
        backed by our capital of honesty, hard work and sincerity and generate further employment opportunities
        which is crucial now-a-days throughout the country.
